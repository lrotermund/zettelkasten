# My privat slip-box/ Zettelkasten
This is my slip-box where I drop and connect all my literature, permanent and project notes.
You are welcome to check out my slip-box vault and use my thoughts on various literature and connect it to your own slip-box.

At unspecified intervals, I will turn my permanent notes into blog articles, which you can find at [lukasrotermund.de](https://lukasrotermund.de). 

## Take smart notes
This repository will be filled with a lot of literature notes build with the "Zettelkasten-Prinzip" (engl. slip-box principal or "how to take smart notes") by Niklas Luhmann, written down by Sönke Ahrens.

Find more information about the Zettelkasten-Prinzip at Sönke's website [takesmartnotes.com](https://takesmartnotes.com).

## Tooling
I use the markdown tool [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) to create, refactor and organize all my slip-box notes. 
Furthermore I use git to version my slip-box notes, to protect them online from data loss, to share them with anyone who is interested and last but not least to use them on all my devices. Git and Obsidian.md are also available for smartphones.
