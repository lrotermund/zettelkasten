# Domain Driven Design

## Putting the Domain Model to Work
- What is a domain?
	- A [[domain]] is a subject area which is applied to a software program
	- Every software program relates to activities, workflows, interactions and interests of its users
	- A [[domain]] represents a model, which is a simplification of a real world or an imaginary problem. E.g. a map is representation, a model of the world that fulfills the requirements of its users
	- Examples:
		- A booking software is a [[domain]] that gets real people on an airplane (physical world)
		- A core banking system is a [[domain]] that handles the abstract money and finances for a bank (imaginary world)
		- A [[domain]] has normally nothing to do with software unless its a source-code control system like git
	- A [[domain model]] is more then a diagram or a drawn abstraction, its all about the idea that could be conveyed by a diagram, by some lines of code, or by some words in a sentence â€“ the medium doesn't matter
